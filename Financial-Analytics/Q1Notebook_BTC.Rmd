------------------Start of Project-----------------



The goal of this notebook and question is to estimate the probability of having cryptocurrency price (BTC/USD) from Coinbase exchange 
be lower by at least 9% at the close on at least one of the next 5 trading days

First we neeed to install the correct packages to ensure the code below works. One package used is for coinbase retrieval


```{r}
library(quantmod)
library(TTR)
library(jsonlite)
library(glue)
library(faraway)
```

We will be looking into retrieving the Bitcoin USD data from coinbase, this code returns around the last 300 days of bitcoin prices.
The variable runFunc holds the data. If we want to retrieve data, need to access file from desktop.

```{r}
# create a function to retrieve daily data from coinbase
retreive_daily_data <- function(pair, filename) {
  url = glue("https://api.pro.coinbase.com/products/{pair}/candles?granularity=86400")
  columnNames <- c('unix', 'low', 'high', 'open', 'close', glue('{pair} volume'))
  mydata <- fromJSON(url)
  df <- as.data.frame(mydata)
  colnames(df) <- columnNames  # rename the columns
  write.csv(df, file = filename)
}


newPair <- "BTC-USD"
fileName <- glue("dailyData{newPair}.csv")
runFunc <- retreive_daily_data(newPair, filename = fileName)
runFunc


```


This block of code looks into retrieving the Bitcoin USD data from YahooFinance, the reason
that YahooFinance is more desired is that it is easier to pick different time ranges of 
BTC to USD price. This code retrieves BTC-USD data for one month, three months, 6 months,
1 year, 5 years.


```{r}
#get data from yahoo in 30 days, 3months, 6, months, 1 yr, 5 yr
oneYearBTC <- getSymbols("BTC-USD", src="yahoo", 
           from=Sys.Date()-365,
           to=Sys.Date(), auto.assign = FALSE)

oneMonthBTC <- getSymbols("BTC-USD", src="yahoo", 
                         from=Sys.Date()-30,
                         to=Sys.Date(), auto.assign = FALSE)
threeMonthBTC <- getSymbols("BTC-USD", src="yahoo", 
                          from=Sys.Date()-90,
                          to=Sys.Date(), auto.assign = FALSE)
sixMonthBTC <- getSymbols("BTC-USD", src="yahoo", 
                          from=Sys.Date()-180,
                          to=Sys.Date(), auto.assign = FALSE)
fiveYearBTC <- getSymbols("BTC-USD", src="yahoo", 
                         from=Sys.Date()-365*5,
                         to=Sys.Date(), auto.assign = FALSE)
```


Next we want to view the data and understand its dimensions and make sure it is expected output. 
We see that it is an xts (will need to change type later) and has nrows of 366 (year + 1),
we will mostly be concerned with closing price data. Additionally we choose which dataset we want to 
analyze.

```{r}
#view data
class(oneYearBTC)
head(oneYearBTC)
nrow(oneYearBTC)

#choose which timeline we want to analyze 1 yr, 1 month, 6 month
chooseTimeFrame <- oneYearBTC
```
The data is being restructured to more easily allow further functions to work. The 
data will no longer be xts, and only the closing price is chosen as point of interest.

```{r}
#convert from timeseries to static, as does not need dates, already ordered seq
data <- data.frame(date=index(chooseTimeFrame), coredata(chooseTimeFrame))
head(data)


#--------use only closing Price data-------#
close <- data[,"BTC.USD.Close"]
length(close)
head(close)
```
Next the daily returns need to be created, this gives datapoints across the timeframe (1 year) of 
what the returns were across this period. Additionally, the log is taken to. Allowing this to occur
will give us a distribution to work off of in further steps. Shows the returns, max/min for a day.
Shows that daily return does not exceed +/- 15% and median is around 0 slightly (+). Thus 
historically its possible to have single day return of -9%.

```{r}
#--------------find the daily log return ---------$
n <- length(close)
lrest <- log(close[-1]/close[-n])
head(lrest)
max(lrest)
min(lrest)
median(lrest)
```



Next the returns of closing prices needs to be visualized and understanding what type of 
distribution is occurring in our data. The histogram plots the data, where it shows
the log returns are normally distributed with "fatter" tails on the left and right of the 
distribution. This is important as it infers that there are more days where the returns are 
extreme, thus this might lead to a larger likelihood of the stock dropping 9% in a day.

The Shapiro test is performed to determine whether or not the distribution is normal.
Considnering the p value is <0.05 we can statistically say the distribution return is not normal
Thus we have to look at QQ plots to understand where its not normal.

The QQ plots indicate that the graph is both right and left skewed, thus it has "fatter" tails as 
mentioned before. This means that when creating random variables for return in simulations, 
the data will be more likely to have larger ranging extreme values. Which could impact the 
9% return loss in a day. But additionally, there are the (+) extreme days which increases
the BTC price greatly.

```{r}
#------------- show histogram - looks normal, need to also do normal dist test----------#
hist(lrest, breaks=14)
summary(lrest)

return.density = density(lrest) # estimate kernel density
plot (return.density) # plot the estimated density

## Shapiro-Wilk test 
shapiro.test(lrest)

library(ggpubr)
ggqqplot(lrest)
#QQ
qqnorm(lrest)
qqline(lrest)
#output implies symmetrics with fat tails



```

Next we need to determine how to randomly generate the distribution when determining
next days expected return. This random generation is important for simulation 
and determining next day return based off of the historical data.

plot(return.density_1)
plot(return.density)

Allows us to compare random generator with acutal distrtibution, if it is similar enough
it can be utilized.

```{r}
#-------make normal dist generator for log return and confirm dist--------#
normal_dist <- rnorm(10000, mean=mean, sd=std)
qqnorm(normal_dist)
qqline(normal_dist)

#h <- dt(lrest, df = 5)

return.density_1 = density(normal_dist)
plot(return.density_1)
plot(return.density)
```


Next we will be creating a set of logical steps to determine the probability of 
the return being greater than -9%.

First we will set some global variables that will be utilized under the simulation

```{r}



#---------- find std and mean of the dataset for random number generator--------#
std <- sd(lrest)
mean <- mean(lrest)
var <-var(lrest)

#make currentpirce last day, set ratio and goal ratio
currentDayPrice <- close[length(close)]
nineLess <- 0.91
ratio <-1
k<-1
```



```{r}

```



This loop finds when the next day price is less than 9% of the current day. It
does this by generating  returns (based off of distribution) and iterating through
this sequence 10,000 times (to be significant). It then does this 100 more times and tells
the probability of success in the iterations.

It can be seen succcess ranges from 94-95% for the one year period. Thus that means that
only 5-6% of the time will there be a daily return of (-9%) in the next 5 days.



```{r}


#iterate 100 times by 10000 iterations 
for(k in 1:100){
    i<-1
    fail<-0
    success <-0
 
    
    #iterate 10000 times
    for (i in 1:10000){
      #reset parameters   after it reaches j=5+
      currentDayPrice_1<- currentDayPrice
      j<-1
      ratio <-1
      
      #less than 5 days and close/previousclose > 0.91
      while(j<6 & ratio>nineLess){
      
        normal_dist <- rnorm(1, mean=mean, sd=std)

        lastdayPrice <- currentDayPrice_1
     
        currentDayPrice_1 <- (1+normal_dist)*lastdayPrice
     
        ratio <- currentDayPrice_1/lastdayPrice
  
        #if we have reached the 5 days and price the ratio day to day is greater 
        #than -9% than count 
        if(j==5 & ratio>nineLess){
          success <- success + 1
       
        }
        #if over these 5 days ratio is less than 0.91 count as fail
        if(ratio<=nineLess){
          fail <- fail+1
         
        }
        
      
        j<-j+1
        
      }
      i<-i+1 
    }
  
    success
    fail
    #indicates percent of time that the closing price DID NOT
    # decrease by 9% from day to day over next 5 days.
    overall_rate <- success/(success+fail)*100
    print(success/(success+fail)*100)
}

```

Print the most recent success rate 

For the one year time line it is 94.89% of not being (-9%) return in the next 5 days, 5% chance 
of it occurring.

```{r}
overall_rate <- success/(success+fail)*100
    print(success/(success+fail)*100)
    print(fail/(success+fail)*100)
```
